# And now for the Weather - Dashboard!

## Description

- A simple JQuery & Javascript weather app that displays the current weather for a city.
- The user inputs a data using the form provided. Upon clicking or pressing enter on the search form, the dashboard is able to display the current weather for the chosen city and the next 5 day forecast.
- This app uses JQuery methods, AJAX calls, APIs, Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap and the moment.js library.
- The moment library helps identify the day and time, and formats and parses UNIX timestamps. 
- The user can select multiple cities that are saved to local storage.
- Each saved city is appended as a button, which when clicked can make an API call to the OpenWeatherMap API, parsing the JSON data available.
- Upon page reload the data remains on the page. The user can clear saved data using the clear button.
